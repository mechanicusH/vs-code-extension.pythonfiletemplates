# Python File Templates

This extensions provides an easy way to create Python Files based on templates by expanding the context menu of the VS Code File Explorer.

In v0.1 all templates are fixed. Future versions will support custom templates.

## Features

Just right-click in the File Explorer and choose the template you want to create. You will be prompted to input the name of the object.

Class names get converted to snake-case as the file name, so "SomeClass" will be safed as "some_class.py".

Currently supported:
* Modules
* Classes

## Requirements

Currently there are no requirements to be met. I will continue to try to keep this extension as small and basic as possible. :)

## Extension Settings

Currently there are no settings available.

## Release Notes

v0.1 Initial Release, yay! :)

## Following extension guidelines

Ensure that you've read through the extensions guidelines and follow the best practices for creating your extension.
